# Jakmar with React - example

This project is just an example of using [Jakmar](https://github.com/FabienDeshayes/jakmar) with [Vue](http://vuejs.org/).

This example let's you build a workflow and visualize it.

## Running the example

To run the example, you need NodeJS and Bower installed. Then install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/) for the build:
```
npm install -g gulp
```

Run the following next:
```
npm install
bower install
```

Then you are ready to go! Just run ```gulp``` and that should open a browser with the example running.

## Jakmar

To illustrate the use of Jakmar, please look at ```src/models/stateDefinition.js```

## Vue
